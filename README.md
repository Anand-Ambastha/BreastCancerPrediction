## 🧬 Breast Cancer Classification using Machine Learning  
This project aims to accurately classify breast cancer tumors as **Malignant (M)** or **Benign (B)** using supervised machine learning models. The focus is on building a reliable and explainable model that performs well not only in accuracy but also in handling real-world data sensitivity using metrics like **Precision**, **Recall**, **F1-Score**, and **Support**.

## 📂 Dataset Details  
**Source**: UCI ML Repository – Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set  

**Features**:  
30 real-valued inputs derived from digital images of breast masses (radius, texture, perimeter, etc.)

**Target (Binary Classification)**:  
- **Malignant (M)** → `1`  
- **Benign (B)** → `0`

## 🔍 Problem Statement  
Early detection of breast cancer is crucial. This classification task helps predict the nature of the tumor and assists medical practitioners in diagnosis. We aim to create a model that **minimizes false negatives** (i.e., not predicting malignant tumors as benign).

---

## 🧪 Models Implemented & Compared  

- **Logistic Regression**  
  A simple, interpretable baseline model.  
  Performed decently but struggled with complex patterns.

- **Random Forest Classifier**  
  Ensemble model that improves accuracy by reducing variance.  
  Handled non-linearity better than Logistic Regression.

- **XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting)** ✅  
  Final selected model.  
  Demonstrated the highest accuracy and balanced performance across all metrics.

---

## ✅ Why XGBoost?  

- Good accuracy on test data.  
- The model must **avoid classifying malignant tumors as benign**.  
- Efficient training time and supports advanced tuning.  
- Feature importance and interpretation available.

## 📈 Performance Metrics  

In real-world healthcare scenarios, accuracy is **not enough**. We must also evaluate:

| Metric      | Description                                                                 |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Precision** | Of all predicted malignant cases, how many were truly malignant? (Low FP) |
| **Recall**    | Of all actual malignant cases, how many were correctly predicted? (Low FN) |
| **F1-Score**  | Harmonic mean of Precision and Recall. Balances both.                      |
| **Support**   | Number of actual instances for each class in the test set.                |

These metrics were derived using `classification_report` from `sklearn.metrics` to ensure fairness and reliability in predictions.

## 📊 Final Results (Approximate)

| Model               | Accuracy | Notes                      |
|--------------------|----------|----------------------------|
| Logistic Regression | ~93%     | Basic linear model         |
| Random Forest       | ~94%     | Good generalization        |
| **XGBoost**         | **~94%** | Best overall performance ✅ |

> 📌 *Note: You can view full classification reports inside the Jupyter notebook for per-class precision and recall.*

## 💡 Future Enhancements  

- Add **ROC-AUC Curve** and **Confusion Matrix** visualization.  
- Tune hyperparameters using **GridSearchCV** or **Optuna**.  
- Integrate model explainability tools like **SHAP** or **LIME**.  
- Save and deploy model using **FastAPI** or **Flask**.
